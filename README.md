# Income-statement-dashboard
This project showcases a PBI that offers clear and interactive insights into financial performance, revenue streams, and expense allocations throughout the current financial year.


## Project Overview

The dashboard provides a dynamic view of:

- Expense Breakdown: Compares salary and non-salary expenses.
- Revenue Streams: Highlights key revenue sources such as teaching income, research grants, and commercial income.
- Income Statement Overview: Presents actuals, commitments, EBITDA, and surplus metrics in a summarized format.
